<!-- Question 3 :
Write a brief intro on available data types in Javascript. -->
  <b>There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.</b> <br>

 1. Number<br><br>
 The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.<br>

There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.
<br>
2.Bigint<br>
In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot represent integer values larger than (253-1) (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -(-253-1) for negatives. It’s a technical limitation caused by their internal representation.

For most purposes that’s quite enough, but sometimes we need really big numbers, e.g. for cryptography or microsecond-precision timestamps.

BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.

A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer<br><br>

3.String<br>
In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.

Double quotes: "Hello".
Single quotes: 'Hello'.
Backticks: `Hello`.
<br>
4.Boolean<br>
The boolean type has only two values: true and false.

This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.
<br>
5.null value<br>
The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.

It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:
