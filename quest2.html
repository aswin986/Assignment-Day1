<!-- Question 2 :
Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples.
 -->
 var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared<br><br>
 var - it is a container to store something<br><br>
 let - allow you to maintain the scope of the variable<br><br>

 const - it is used to make a value constant<br><br>
